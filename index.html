				Hello, my name is Matthew Istvan, but I usually go by just
				'Matt'. I'm a full-time Computer Science student and part-time
				retail worker. I'm currently studying Web and Java development,
				in the past I have also studied AI and machine learning. In my
				free time I enjoy playing games and listening to music.
